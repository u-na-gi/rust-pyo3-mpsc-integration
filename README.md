# rust-pyo3-mpsc-integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate Rust and Python using `PyO3` and `NumPy`. The project enables Rust to offload computational tasks to Python asynchronously. Python tasks are executed in parallel, allowing Rust to continue processing while awaiting Pythonâ€™s results. This setup is managed using Docker for seamless environment setup.

## Features
- **Asynchronous Task Execution**: Run Python functions asynchronously from Rust, receiving computation results without blocking Rust's execution.
- **NumPy Integration**: Python functions leverage NumPy for handling computationally intensive tasks.
- **Multi-threaded Worker**: Rust employs a multi-threaded worker system to communicate with Python for efficient task management.

## Requirements
- Docker

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rust-pyo3-mpsc-integration.git
   cd rust-pyo3-mpsc-integration
   ```

2. **Build the Docker environment**
   Run the following command to build the Docker container and set up the environment:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests that validate the Rust-Python integration, use the following command:
```bash
make test
```

This will execute the tests defined in the Rust code, ensuring that the Rust worker correctly sends and receives data from the Python side.

## Project Structure

- `Cargo.toml`: Defines Rust dependencies such as `ndarray`, `numpy`, and `pyo3`.
- `docker-compose.yaml`: Configures Docker services for the project.
- `src/`: Contains the Rust source code, including the Python worker module and tests.
- `src-py/`: Contains the Python code, including a NumPy-based heavy computation example.
